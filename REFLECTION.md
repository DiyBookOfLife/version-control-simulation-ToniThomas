# Project Reflection

<p> 
First, I created the repo remotely on GitHub & cloned it. Then, I created 2 local branches, feature/header & feature/footer, & tracked local changes to each with git add & git commit. Next, I merged main with feature/footer with no issues but when I attempt to merge main with branch feature/header, I ran into a merge conflict. I resolved the conflict by editing the html, then running git add . & git commit to finalize the merge. 
</p>

<p>Once I had feature/header, feature/footer and main all merged into the main branch, I then added the local repo to the remote repo with git push. From GitHub, I attempt to create a PR but couldn't because there was only 1 branch. So, I created another branch, review/main, and edit the html on the main branch, to create a PR for review/main. This step was a voila moment for me because it showed me the difference in local branches vs remote branches!</p>

<p>The PR process helped ensure code quality by adding a checkpoint before merging my changes into the main branch. This additional step can eliminate possible errors. The process also helps with collaboration by allowing others to review, commit and approve requests, allowing developers to maintain code quality and ownership! </p>

This project helped reinforce my understanding of how Git manages branches and history in a workflow. It clarified the difference between local repositories and remote repositories, as well as how branches can exist independently in each. As someone who has been self-taught, this project also gave me my first structured experience with collaboration-style workflows, such as using pull requests, reviews, and approvals before merging changes. Overall, this project improved my confidence in using Git commands intentionally rather than relying on trial and error, and it demonstrated how structured version control practices help teams work efficiently while maintaining code quality and shared ownership.
